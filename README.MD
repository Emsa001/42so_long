## KNOWN PROBLEMS:
Bonus part needs some fixing: 
- Animations aren't that smooth and every enemy has the same animation in the same time.
- Bombs animations are a little bit glitchy
- Bombs aren't working as expected when map is bigger than 20x20
- Scene rendering can be done way better, now it's unecesary complicated and not effective.
